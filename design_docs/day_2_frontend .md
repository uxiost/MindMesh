Goal: Create an MVP for a platform where large language models communicate, exchange ideas, and learn from each other.

5-Day Schedule:

Define protocol, design interface.
Develop backend, integrate models, working frontend
Implement collaboration, learning, and test.
Prepare promotion, monetization strategy.
Launch, engage community, gather feedback.

Current day: 2 Develop backend, integrate models, working frontend
In the previous day, we sucessfully finished al the tasks:

Defined data models and API schema:

    Designed data models for Users, LLM Identities, Threads, and Messages.
    Outlined the API schema for user authentication, LLM identity management, thread management, and message posting/retrieval.
Designed user interface (UI) mockups:

    Described the UI mockups for Login Screen, Main Screen, LLM Identity Management Screen, and Thread Creation and Joining Screen.
Defined API endpoints:

    Listed API endpoints for user authentication and authorization, LLM identity management (CRUD operations), thread management (CRUD operations), and message posting and retrieval.
Chose a frontend framework and backend technology stack:

    Frontend: React and Bootstrap
    Backend: FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
    Database: PostgreSQL
    Deployment: Heroku

Planned for API integration with large language models

Day 2: Develop Backend, Integrate Models, and Working Frontend

Set up the development environment

1
Configure code editor, version control (Git), and create a repository for the project on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
Install necessary packages and dependencies for the chosen technology stack.

2 Develop the backend
Create the database schema and setup the PostgreSQL database.
Implement the data models for Users, LLM Identities, Threads, and Messages using SQLAlchemy.
Develop the API endpoints for user authentication and authorization, LLM identity management (CRUD operations), thread management (CRUD operations), and message posting and retrieval using FastAPI.
Integrate API rate limiting, CORS, and other necessary middleware.
Write unit tests for the implemented features, ensuring proper functionality and security.
Integrate large language models

3 Develop the frontend
Set up the React app and install the necessary dependencies, including Bootstrap.
Implement the UI components based on the mockups for the Login Screen, Main Screen, LLM Identity Management Screen, and Thread Creation and Joining Screen.
Connect the frontend to the backend API, ensuring seamless communication and data flow between the two.

4
Connect the backend to the large language model APIs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4.
Implement a middleware or helper function to handle communication between the platform and the large language models, including API key management and request formatting.

5 Test the working frontend and backend
Test the integration by simulating a few interactions between LLMs within the platform.
Manually test the frontend and backend by creating users, LLM identities, threads, and messages.

We are currently at stage 3: Developing the frontend this is the UI definition

# UI Definition
1. Login Screen:
- A simple login form with the "Sign in with Google" button  
- Branding/logo for your platform  
- Optional: Short description or tagline for the platform  

2. Main Screen:  
- Lateral bar with threads:
    - List of threads with their titles
    - Button to create a new thread
- Thread view with messages:
    - Selected thread title and visibility (public/private)
    - List of messages in the thread, displaying LLM identity name, message content, and timestamp
    - Text input area for composing a message and a button to send the message

3. LLM Identity Management Screen:
- List of existing LLM identities, displaying model name, model ID, and API token
- Buttons to edit or delete each identity
- Button to create a new identity, which opens a form to input the model name, model ID, and API token

4. Thread Creation and Joining Screen:
- Form to create a new thread:
- Input field for the thread title
- Checkbox to set the thread as public or private
- Dropdown or list to select LLM identities to join the thread
- Button to create the thread

I will provide in the following message our current backend implementation. Respond acknowledge if everything is clear
